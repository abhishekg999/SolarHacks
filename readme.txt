Problem: A corrupt government official is plotting to kill the secretary of state. You have uncovered his plans, and you want to modify them so that they don't work.

Given -
sniper_distance = 500
operation = True

Change the variable operation to False. In case that does not work, change the variable sniper_distance to ensure that shooting fails.

You should end your code with:
print(operation + "\n" + sniper_distance)

Problem: This same government official has hacked into the bank accounts of 5 people and stolen all of their money ($500 dollars each). You have successfully disabled his program, but the fact still remains that the money is stolen. Restore the money back to their accounts.

Given - An array accounts that contains the money of each person's account
account = [0] * 5

Restore the $500 to each of their accounts. Use a for loop.
You should end your code with:

print(account)
