This is a project for SolarHacks

This project is meant to teach students and other kids programming in a way that is intuitive and fun
The classic "hacking" that is shown in hollywood is very attractive and something that will persuade people to want to join the field. By keeping that aesthetic in our program, and having hacking like puzzles, it will make programmng fun and easy to learn.
